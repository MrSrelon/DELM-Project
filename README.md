# DELM: Deep Emotional Learning Model

This is a minimal proof-of-concept demo for DELM (Deep Emotional Learning Model) â€” a system that mimics artificial emotions based on action-reward loops. Inspired by the idea that AI can "feel" through dynamic, feedback-driven responses.

## Features
- Simulates emotions like happiness, fear, anger, boredom, and curiosity
- Emotion state evolves based on actions and outcomes
- Emotions influence future decisions (feedback loop)
- Simple visual output with emotion trends over time

## Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 v1_emotion_engine.py
